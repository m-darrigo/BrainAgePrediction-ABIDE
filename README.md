# BrainAgePrediction-ABIDE
This repository, managed by Marco D'Arrigo, exhibits my exam project for the Computing Methods for Experimental Physics and Data Analysis course. 
The project is centered around developing an algorithm capable of predicting brain age by analyzing features extracted from brain MRIs.

The dataset used is derived from the well-known ABIDE dataset, including subjects affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and healthy control subjects (CTR). 
The algorithm, crafted for this purpose, is equipped to:

- Data Understanding & Preparation.
- implement regression models
- Evaluate and compare prediction performance.
